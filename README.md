# Twitter Misinformation Detection Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify and extract potential misinformation from a dataset of Twitter posts using **PolitiFact**, a trusted source for fact-checking political statements. The primary objective is to cross-reference tweets related to politics or made by politicians with PolitiFact's database to determine their validity.

## Dataset Description
### **Twitter Dataset**
- **Source**: [Stanford Twitter Dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/twitter7.html)
- **Description**:
  - Contains 467 million Twitter posts from 20 million users.
  - Covers a 7-month period: June 1, 2009, to December 31, 2009.

### **PolitiFact Data**
- **Source**: [PolitiFact Website](https://www.politifact.com/)
- **Description**:
  - PolitiFact labels statements by politicians as true, false, or varying levels of accuracy.
  - Data from PolitiFact will be used to verify tweets for potential misinformation.

## Objectives
1. Investigate PolitiFact and explore how to extract or scrape its data for analysis.
2. Analyze the Twitter dataset to filter tweets:
   - Related to politics.
   - Made by politicians.
3. Cross-reference filtered tweets with PolitiFact data to identify misinformation.

## Steps to Follow
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Download and preprocess the Twitter dataset.
   - Analyze its structure and identify relevant features for filtering.
   - Investigate metadata fields to filter tweets by topics and authorship.

2. **PolitiFact Investigation**:
   - Study PolitiFact's data structure and labeling mechanism.
   - Explore methods to programmatically extract or access PolitiFact data using APIs or scraping techniques.

3. **Cross-Referencing**:
   - Develop an automated system to match filtered tweets with PolitiFact entries.
   - Identify and label tweets as misinformation based on PolitiFact's data.

4. **Output**:
   - Generate a clean dataset of tweets labeled as misinformation.
   - Provide insights into the volume and nature of misinformation in the dataset.
